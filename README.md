# WIP Item Update
This is a work in progress update for adding items. Please note that as this is work in progress, I cannot guarantee the stability of this version of the API, nor can I resolve all errors you encounter while using this version of the API. Currently, this allows you to add custom items, but as of yet, giving items effects or values does not seem to effect anything beyond the description in game.

Included is item-mod -- my test mod for checking on added items and effects. It currently modifies the cat symbol to add the custom item for testing purposes.
